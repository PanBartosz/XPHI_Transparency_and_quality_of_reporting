# Prescreening Procedure

This directory contains data from the prescreening procedure performed by the members of the research team (BM, KK, JG, MG, FK).

`final_bins/{1-6}_verdicts_final.xlsx` contains the final verdicts for each paper in the permuted bins. In the `VERDICT` column, there is a final decision about the inclusion of the paper in the study (`1` means inclusion, `0` means exclusion). In the columns corresponding to the team members (`KK`, `BM`, `JG`, `MG`, and `FK`), you can find the individual verdicts. Some papers raised controversies. All controversies were resolved during discussions, but for the sake of transparency, we indicate the criterion responsible for the controversy in the `JUSTIFICATION` column. A detailed description of the criteria can be found in our OSF registration.

1. **Written in English** (`ENGLISH` for inclusion, `NOT_ENGLISH` for exclusion)  
   - No actual papers were controversial for this reason.
2. **Published between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2024, in an academic journal or a monograph.** (`PUBLISHED` for inclusion, `NOT_PUBLISHED` for exclusion)  
   - Some papers were published elsewhere, and some papers have a wrong publication date or misleading bibliographic references.
3. **Describes at least one original empirical study** (`ORIGINAL_DATA` for inclusion, `NO_ORIGINAL_DATA` for exclusion)  
   - Sometimes it was difficult to determine whether the data were original.
4. **Concerns experimental philosophy** (`XPHI` for inclusion, `NOT_XPHI` for exclusion)  
   - Sometimes it was difficult to decide whether the paper can be described as experimental philosophy; this was the category that generated the most discussion.
