# Transparency and Quality of Reporting in Experimental Philosophy – A Survey Study

This is the main repository for the study on quality of reporting in experimental philosophy.

This study is part of the project "Meta-analyses in Experimental Philosophy". See [https://meta.kognilab.pl](https://meta.kognilab.pl) for further information.

## Structure of the Repository

Due to the large number of steps required to carry out the project, files are categorized thematically. The repository will be expanded as the project progresses. Each directory contains a separate `README` file with a detailed description of its contents.

- `01_SAMPLING` - Data and code used to sample papers from the PhilPapers database.
- `02_PREESCREENING` - Final sample of papers after the prescreening procedure.
- `03_INVENTORY` - X-PHI Transparency and Quality of Reporting Inventory, including the scoring system.
