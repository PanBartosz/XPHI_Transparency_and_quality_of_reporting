# Transparency and Quality of Reporting Inventory

This repository contains the inventory and coding system. Please note that the main repository for the web app used for coding is located at [https://github.com/PanBartosz/metacoder](https://github.com/PanBartosz/metacoder). Here, we include only the necessary details.

- `TQRI.yaml` - Contains all questions with the scoring system in computer-readable form. The structure of the file is self-explanatory and clear. The `parts` key defines the sections referred to in the preregistration.
- `scoring.txt` - Human-readable items in the inventory, including:  
  a) Scores for each question and each option;  
  b) The weight assigned to each question within the section.
- `inspect_scoring.py` - A script that can be used to generate `scoring.txt` from `TQRI.yaml`.

**Note:** This is a second version of the original inventory created by KK, BM, and WMH. We obtained permission from WMH to use and revise this work.
