# Agreement Reports

This directory contains the HTML reports generated during the pilot phase of coding. They summarize inter-coder agreement on a subset of papers from our larger study on experimental philosophy (X-PHI) transparency and quality reporting.

- `reports`  
  A collection of HTML files, each documenting the coding results (agreements, disagreements, and percentage agreement) for a specific paper. These were generated by the `metacoder` tool using the data in the `data` directory. The filenames correspond to the BibTeX keys used in `01_SAMPLING` and `02_PRESCREENING`.
- `agreement.Rmd`  
  An R Markdown file that processes the reports in this directory. It extracts relevant statistics — such as total columns processed, number of agreements, disagreements, and the percentage agreement — and compiles them into summary tables.
- `agreement.html`  
  The compiled report, produced from `agreement.Rmd`.
- `XPHITQRI.yaml`  
  An updated version of the `XPHITQRI.yaml` from `03_INVENTORY`. Several small changes to the phrasing of items and the coding instructions were made, which can be inspected by comparing the two versions.

**Note:** For more information on how these reports were generated, please see the main `metacoder` repository: [PanBartosz/metacoder](https://github.com/PanBartosz/metacoder).
